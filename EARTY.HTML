Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants.
Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.</FONT>

Many things that are useful to people produce pollution. Cars spew pollutants from their exhaust pipes. Burning coal to create electricity pollutes the air. Industries and homes generate garbage and sewage that can pollute the land and water. Pesticides—chemical poisons used to kill weeds and insects—seep into waterways and harm wildlife.</FONT>

AIR POLLUTION
</H2></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4">
Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants into the air—pollutants which are detrimental to human health and the planet as a whole. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year air pollution is responsible for nearly seven million deaths around the globe. Nine out of ten human beings currently breathe air that exceeds the WHO’s guideline limits for pollutants, with those living in low- and middle-income countries suffering the most.</FONT>

What are the causes of Air Pollution?
</h3></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4">
Air pollution is caused by solid and liquid particles and certain gases that are suspended in the air. These particles and gases can come from car and truck exhaust, factories, dust, pollen, mold spores, volcanoes and wildfires. The solid and liquid particles suspended in our air are called aerosols.

How does air pollution affect Earth’s climate?
</H3></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4">
Aerosols can impact how the Sun’s light hits Earth. For example, some aerosols reflect sunlight while others absorb sunlight. It depends on the color of the particle.Dark surfaces—whether it’s a black t-shirt or a dark particle in the atmosphere—absorb the Sun's heat. Lighter-colored surfaces reflect heat from the Sun.A white t-shirt reflects the Sun on a hot day, making you feel cooler. In the same way, light-colored particles that reflect the Sun’s light and heat away from Earth can make the global temperature cooler. Dark-colored particles that absorb the Sun’s light can make the global temperature warmer.

WATER POLLUTION
</H2></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4">
Water pollution happens when toxic substances enter water bodies such as lakes, rivers, oceans and so on, getting dissolved in them, lying suspended in the water or depositing on the bed. This degrades the quality of water.
Not only does this spell disaster for aquatic ecosystems, the pollutants also seep through and reach the groundwater, which might end up in our households as contaminated water we use in our daily activities, including drinking.</FONT>

Sources and effects of water pollution
</H3></P>
<p><FONT SIZE="4">
Water pollution can be caused in a number of ways, one of the most polluting being city sewage and industrial waste discharge. Indirect sources of water pollution include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rain.
Soils and groundwaters contain the residue of human agricultural practices and also improperly disposed of industrial wastes.</FONT>

Some General Ways to Prevent Water Pollution
<UL>
If you can, pick up litter and garbage by hand, and take it to your personal garbage can before it travels into local waterways.
Never put chemicals down the drain. Place them into your outside garbage can or take them to the local authorized center.
Wash your car where the water and soap can go to a dirt or grass area instead of a street and drain to the river or creek.

The degradation of the earth’s land surfaces, both above and below ground level, is referred to as land pollution.

Land pollution occurs when trash, compost, and other toxins are dumped on the land, contaminating or polluting it. Land pollution is caused by human activities such as littering and waste washed ashore from boats, oil rigs, and sewage treatment plants.The degradation of the earth’s land surfaces, both above and below ground level, is referred to as land pollution. The accumulation of solid and liquid waste products, which contaminate groundwater and soil, is the cause. The greater the permeability of the soil, the greater the risk of land contamination.</FONT>

To reduce land emissions, reduce, reuse, and recycle. It is essential to practice reforestation and afforestation. Organic fertilizers, an integrated pest control method, and crop rotation can all be used by farmers. One of the most important ways to help minimize landfill waste, protect natural resources, preserve wildlife, reduce noise, reduce energy use, and slow global warming is to incorporate recycling habits into your everyday life.</FONT>
