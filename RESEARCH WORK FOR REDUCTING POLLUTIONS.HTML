Graviky Labs was the first ever to produce Air-Ink, ink made out of pollution. It is one of the most innovative inventions to reduce Air Pollution Their invention, Kaalnik, can be fitted onto generators and fuel tanks to capture air pollution and convert it to usable ink. Their retrofit technology can be modified to all sizes for capturing air pollution.</FONT>

One of the most notable innovations to curb pollution was the smog-free tower. It is a vertical structure, placed in public locations, which turns like a giant wheel. It sucks in smog and converts it into breathable air using ionization technology. Probably one of the most innovative inventions to reduce Air Pollution.

Algae curtains are curtains made of plastic tubes stacked next to each other. These tubes contain microscopic algae and can be used to suck the carbon-dioxide from the air and do photosynthesis, thus reducing pollution.

Electric cars have become a common term these days. But these are the ones that can drastically reduce pollution. Vehicle emissions are a significant air pollutant â€“ with electric cars in the picture, pollutants from vehicles will be reduced as people start to adapt to the new form of transport.
